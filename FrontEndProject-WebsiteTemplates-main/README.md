# FrontEndProject-Templates-Website
This project is a website Rishi,Aayush,Jayden,Ash,Shyam,Krish created to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a website that provide career counseling for highschool students. 

CareerHub is a website we developed to help students find out what career they are interested in to learn in the future. This model allow students to, additionaly, learn courses from the STEAM, Business, and Medical fields. The survey based questioning for the user is implemented using a chatbot that asks career and character questions to generate what the best field for the user is based of input. Adding on to make this website presentable, we used a tamplte from github which contained a MIT lisence. The github template was by jaydjunz called FrontEndProject-WebsiteTemplates. This website template helped us alot for sparking ideas and lay a foundation for how our website is organized. We also used sources such as KhanAcdemy,Coursera,YouTube, etc... for the students that want to learn. We also used a chatbot for the survey we conducted for the major/feild interests for the students. This chatbot was made using poe.com. Overall we had a really fun time making this website, learned a lot of new skills, and made new friends.
